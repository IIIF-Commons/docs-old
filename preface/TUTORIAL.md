## Tutorial

I will step through the creation of a component called SvgDraw that will allow us to create SVG shapes that can be used as overlays in OpenSeadragon (or elsewhere).

Successfully replicate the component-boilerplate.

### Step 2
Use an external library. In this case we will be using Paper.js.
