# Start Here

_So, this all makes sense, but where do I begin?_

The easiest way to create your own component would be to start modifying the [Boilerplate Component](../libraries/COMPONENT-BOILERPLATE.md). This project provides the minimal setup required to create a reusable component.  The process is documented in the [tutorial provided in this book](/tutorial.md), in which you will create a component that draws svg shapes on a canvas.
