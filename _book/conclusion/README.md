#Closing Thoughts

## We're Not Done
This book will continue to evolve along with the corresponding tools and techniques. We plan to continue publishing updates to keep the contents current. We also intend this to be a DRY approach, so if better documentation exists elsewhere (say a component repository), we will link to that, rather than recreate it here.

## Feedback
